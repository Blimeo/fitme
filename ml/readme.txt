Unzip train to /data/train and test to /data/test
with password 2019Deepfashion2**
So final directory structure should look something like
/data
  /train
    /annos
    /image
  /test
    /test
    /json_for_test

(Honestly we probably don't need to worry about test data)
    

To setup:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
